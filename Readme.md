# PTable

A simple command-line tool for generating a multiplication table of Prime Numbers.

This repo tracks the passes I made over the code from quick sketch, to adding a bit
of structure and defining the expected behavior in tests, to refactoring and optimizing.

To run: `./ptable (limit)` where `limit` is an optional argument for largest prime number to include.
By default, `limit` is 30. Note that `limit` itself does not need to be prime.
